## Introduction

The **OnlineNewsPopularity** data set has a total of 61 variables. There
are 2 non-predictive variables, 58 predictive variables, and 1 target
variable. The purpose of this program is to explore how well two
different types of models, a liner regression model and an ensemble
model, predict the `shares` (target) variable. To do so, we will
separate the **OnlineNewsPopularity** data set into training and testing
data sets and use the training data set to train the models. Then, we
will test the models using the testing data set and compare the accuracy
of the two models. We will automate the Rmarkdown file to repeat this
process and create a report for each day of the week.
